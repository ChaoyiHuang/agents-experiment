A collection of more than thousand small coral atolls, the Maldives is located on the equator towards the south of India and stretches across 800 km (500 mi) of the Indian Ocean on a north-south axis. The stunningly beautiful islands are the visible coral tips of an oceanic volcanic mountain range whose outer edges at some points plunge to depths of over 3 km (10,000 ft). The archipelago is blessed with some of the world’s most astonishing beaches, crystal clear turquoise lagoons, phenomenal underwater wildlife, and unrivaled luxury resorts that take up their own private islands.\n\nIt’s difficult of course to select 10 resorts in a destination which is home to dozens of sublime hotels. The resorts in this list represent my favorite properties in the Maldives for a variety of reasons and they all feature magnificent locations, superb accommodations, terrific fine-dining restaurants, spectacular beaches, world-class spas, excellent leisure facilities, and a sustainable ethos. Importantly, all the resorts in this list are set on natural islands, contrary to the artificial islands which are springing up like mushrooms in the Maldives’ North & South Atolls. Although some of these artificial islands are home to mind-blowing resorts, the beauty of these islands can never compete with the lush tropical beauty of natural islands and they also destroy the local eco-system (hence why you won’t find in this list resorts that are built on 100% man-made islands).\n\nHere’s my selection of the 10 best luxury resorts and hotels in the Maldives. These resorts definitely come with a hefty price tag (a daily room rate of more than $3000 USD per night is the norm at some of these hotels in high season), so make sure to read [my tips for getting the best deal at a luxury hotel](https://theluxurytravelexpert.com/book-a-hotel/). Spoiler alert: once you have experienced the otherworldly luxury of a Maldivian resort, any other beach holiday experience will pale in comparison. I also have some great news as I can offer you **complimentary VIP perks at the Maldives’ most exclusive resorts**!

ALILA KOTHAIFARU MALDIVES](https://www.alilahotels.com/kothaifaru-maldives/)**\n\nSet on a 27.6 acre \xa0(11.2 hectare) island in the remote Raa Atoll, Alila Kothaifaru Maldives can be reached via a 45-minute seaplane journey from the Maldives’ capital Malé. The resort’s elegant minimalist architecture by Singapore-based Studiogoto encompasses terraced pavilions, villas and a treetop spa that are carefully integrated into the existing landscape to immerse guests in the picturesque natural surroundings. The low-rise structures and contemporary interiors feature open-air spaces and a calming palette of island-inspired colors and textures, creating an idyllic setting for complete relaxation and connection with nature. There are 80 pool villas, of which 44 are along the beach and 36 are perched overwater with direct access to the sea. The property offers a delightful variety of culinary experiences including Seasalt, the resort’s beachside all-day dining restaurant, and Umami, which offers Japanese-inspired\xa0 menus. Alila Kothaifaru Maldives deserves a spot on this top 10 list since it ranks among the most affordable 5-star hotels in the Maldives.\n\n* **Hotel website**: [Alila Kothaifaru Maldives](https://www.alilahotels.com/kothaifaru-maldives/)\n* **Review**: read my review of Alila Kothaifaru Maldives [here](https://theluxurytravelexpert.com/2023/07/19/review-alila-kothaifaru-maldives/).\n\n---\n\n##### **[9. JUMEIRAH MALDIVES OLHAHALI ISLAND](https://www.jumeirah.com/en/stay/maldives/jumeirah-maldives)**\n\nSurrounded by the sapphire seas of the Indian Ocean, Jumeirah Maldives Olhahali Island is a secluded sanctuary dedicated to all things luxury. The intimate resort is located on the northernmost tip of the North Malé Atoll and is easily reachable by a 60 min speedboat ride or 15 min seaplane flight.\xa0Each of the 67 expansive villas features a private rooftop terrace, infinity pool, and 24/7 butler service. The overwater spa offers decadent signature rituals inspired by Ayurvedic tradition. The resort’s surprising panoramic architecture and calming interiors are the work of Singaporean design studio, Miaja, who have created an elegant contemporary ethos in harmony with the natural environment, echoing modern Mediterranean chic. Activities ranging from yoga classes and underwater photography excursions to a beachside splash park (and babysitting services) ensure a rejuvenating stay for everyone.\n\n* **Hotel website**: [Jumeirah Maldives\xa0Olhahali Island](https://www.jumeirah.com/en/stay/maldives/jumeirah-maldives)\n* **Tip**: get complimentary VIP perks when booking via [Virtuoso](https://www.classictravel.com/hotels/jumeirah-maldives-olhahali-island?agent=LuxTravelExpert) (e.g. room upgrade, daily breakfast, early check-in, late check-out, $75 USD resort credit, enhanced recognition through VIP status at all touch points throughout the guest experience, and complimentary one way airport transfer to suite guests).\n* **Review**: read my review of Jumeirah Maldives Olhahali Island [here](https://theluxurytravelexpert.com/2023/07/05/review-jumeirah-maldives/).\n\n---\n\n##### **[8.
